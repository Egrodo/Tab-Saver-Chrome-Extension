# Tab Saver

One button click to save your current tab session offline for later restoring.
Tab Saver provides a friendly little button that, upon pressing, will close and save all your open tabs to local storage for easy restoring later.

Features include:

- Up to 95% memory reduction by saving your tab session for later.
- Can be used as an alternative to extensions like Panic Button and OneTab.
- Simple and colorful tab preview page that randomly generates a new background every time.
- Gathers absolutely zero information on you and is completely open source
- Super small extension, doesn't run in the background when not used, doesn't add any bloat to your browser.

More features will be added as I think of them, suggestions welcome.
